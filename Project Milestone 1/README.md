# Executive Project Summary (NOT LONGER THAN 1 PAGE, NOT TOO SHORT)
##### Clearly identifies the context of the problem addressed by your project. Answers the question - Why is this an area of interest?
### What are you doing and why? Why is this an area of interest:
Intelligent, voice-controlled systems are a new and emerging technology now being found in many homes.  
In 2014, Amazon launched their new voice controlled assistant called Alexa.  It has been integrated into the Echo and furhter into the Echo Dot series.

Echo dots vulnerabilities for evocativeness:
Directly attached to home WiFi, Amazon Account, can do a lot of interesting things: (LIST HERE)
Skills connect device to home products = danger
Bluetooth remote that connects.
Device is brand new and hasn't been throughly investigated for vulnerabilities, potential vulnerabilitiy in many individuals' homes.

### Goals, objectives, (GOALS MUST BE BULLETED):
##### Efforts are clearly tied to addressing the identified problem. Goals are stated at a high level and are free of technical jargon or uncessary detail.
Pentesting experience
Learn how to hack devices, map devices, use cases, etc.
Plan a thourough investigation into the security of a device.
Objective is a fully-scoped pentest into Echo Dot v2.  Try and see if we can find any vulnerabilities.

### Merit
##### The benefits for pursing the project are clear and tied to addressing the identified problem(s). End user, societal, and industrial benefits are stated - if relevant.
Worthy because new firmware is hard to load (locked out of debugger) - very little research has been done.  Will be tough task to find a vulnerability

# Proposed Project Timeline
##### Specify large tasks to be completed, estimates time of completion, and arranges those tasks chronologically over the project lifespan.
